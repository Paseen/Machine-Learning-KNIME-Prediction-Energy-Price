# Progetto-Machine-Learning

For this project me and three colleagues of mine tried to forecast the price of energy in Spain using the KNIME platform, training four different models, Random Forest, XGBoost, ARIMA and LSTM, using hourly historical data from 2015 to 2018, and then we compared their performances.
